- 👋 Hi, I’m Robby Wideman
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity & Leaning Computer Programming/Coding Languages.  I hope to be a "polyglot" someday.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic coding stuff on freeCodeCamp.  I've completed the Responsive Web Design series (I think it helped I took Web Design in high school, but it was plain html and html5 back then, and we didn't even touch on CSS.
- 💞️ I’m changing careers.  I spent 20+ years in law enforcement, private security, and private investigations.  Unfortunately, my back tells me "no" when it comes to most physical activity.  I loved learning about tech and coding when I was a teenager, so now I'm starting school to earn dual AS degrees, one in Cybersecurity Practitioner, and the second in Computer Programming.  My current inclination is to seek out a job in Cybersecurity, but I do love what I've learned from coding so far.  Right now while I'm in school, I'm looking for a part time or otherwise flexible remote job in some sort of Cybersecurity related role (Security Auditing, etc.).  I'm still at the beginning stages of my education in this new adventure, but I'm a quick learner!
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me by emailing me at robbywideman@usnavy.vet or kj6gcs@gmail.com (the kj6gcs email is my primary).  I am also working on my professional portfolio website, so it's a work in progress with SUPER messy code, but if you want to check it out and give me some pointers, it's at https://www.robbywideman.dev , but be gentle, lol.  You can view my LinkedIn profile at https://www.linkedin.com/in/robbywideman to check out my various professional certificates, trainings, etc.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an ISC(2) Candidate for Certified in Cybersecurity, just need to go take the exam (it's a _bit_ of a drive to the testing center).  I'm also preparing to sit for my certification as a Google Cloud Digital Leader.  I'm currently learning HTML5, CSS, C#, and SQL/Relational Databases.  Once I'm done with those courses (thank you freeCodeCamp!) I'm going to move on to Python and _try_ to learn JavaScript.  I tried working with Java before, but I don't think I was ready for it.

Thanks for visiting!

-Robby-
