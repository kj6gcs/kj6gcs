Hello, There!
My name is Robby Wideman, and I am currently a Cybersecurity student at Butte College (California).  As part of my degree program, I elected to go through the Cisco Certified Network Associate track (CCNA).  CCNA is an entry-level certification from Cisco which will validate my ability to install, configure, and troubleshoot networks (this includes fundamentals, security, and more).  I’ll be finishing up my AS in Cybersecurity at the end of Spring 2026 and will begin working toward my Cybersecurity Bachelor’s degree through Western Governors University a couple of months after that.

At Butte College, I serve as the Student Senator for Career Technical Education on the student government board.  As part of my duties as a Student Senator, I also participate in several of the college’s committees, including being a seated/voting member of the Guided Pathways Committee.  I’m also a member of the school’s ACM Chapter / Computer Science Club, where I serve as the club’s ICC (Inter Club Council) Representative.  
Also, as a member of Butte College’s Computer Science Club, I participate in the National Cyber League in both individual and team competitions.  For the Fall 2025 season, I placed 379th out of 7,869 individual participants; for the team game, our team Roadrunner Protocol placed 237th out of 4,214 teams (with just me and one other teammate!)

My passion for working with and on computers started in high school with basic HTML websites, back in the era of Geocities (yes, we’re talking mid/late 90’s haha!), as well as essentially the high school version of A+ (basic ROP Computer Repair).  Out of high school, I joined the US Navy, and after returning home, ended up working in private security/law enforcement/private investigations for the next 20-ish years.  My back now tells me “no” when it comes to the physical demands of that line of work, so now I’m in the process of returning to technology.

As some side-learning, I tinker around with Web Development still, having taken a couple of courses at Butte College.  A lot has changed since my high school days, but I still enjoy web design – now using a combination of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, and much more!  For my final project in my first semester of WebDev, I constructed a portfolio website using React, which can be seen at: https://www.robbywideman.dev.

Feel to reach out to me with any questions, or just to say hi!


Thanks for visiting!
